# Hello
A little box full of Fice's work

Hallo, I’m @Fice64 and this is my readme, I'll talk a little 'bout me and... yeah.
I’m interested in videogames! I know it is normal in these days but I always wanted to make one. Now that I have seen hoy the world has evolver I want to create, at least a VR game!
I’m currently learning HTML & Python, I want to learn C# or JS but... I'm starting with the basics 
In my future I want to work with... Google! or... Sony! or... Nintendo! I haven't decided yet :P
If you ever want to talk with me you can use Whatsapp and talk to me, my phone number is +573193419454 or via gmail tomasmachado16ägmail.com
And that's it. For now I don't have an interesting project I can tell you about... But maybe in the future I will have one!
How do I separate this...
